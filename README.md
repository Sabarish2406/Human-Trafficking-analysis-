Human Trafficking Analysis

Overview:
This project aims to analyze human trafficking trends using Python, Linear Regression, and PowerBI. By leveraging data-driven insights, we seek to understand and address key factors contributing to human trafficking.

Steps:

1. Data Collection:
Collect and compile relevant datasets containing information on human trafficking incidents, demographics, and socio-economic factors.

2. Data Cleaning:
Employ Python for data cleaning, handling missing values, and ensuring data integrity.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Utilize Python for EDA to uncover patterns, correlations, and potential features impacting human trafficking.

4. Linear Regression Modeling:
Apply Linear Regression in Python to model relationships between variables and predict human trafficking trends.

5. PowerBI Dashboard Creation:
  - Import cleaned data into PowerBI for dashboard creation.
  - Design interactive visualizations to present human trafficking insights.
  - Utilize PowerBI functionalities to analyze and filter data dynamically.
